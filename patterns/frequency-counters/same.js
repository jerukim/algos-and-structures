write a function called same, which accepts two arrays.
the function should return true if every value in the array has it's corresponding values squared in the second array.
the frequency of values must be the same.

arr1 and arr2 must have the same length
do we know which array is going to be squared? 
    we can pragmatically determine this by comparing the first element of each array to see which one is larger
are the array elements always going to be numbers? we can type check and return false
